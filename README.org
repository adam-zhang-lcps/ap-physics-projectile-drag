#+title: Projectile Motion Drag Simulation
#+author: Adam Zhang

Simulating projectile motion with drag and displaying the results. Extra credit assignment for my AP Physics C: Mechanics class. Built using [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] and [[https://iced.rs/][Iced]] ðŸ”¥.

* Building
To build, you will need the [[https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started][Rust toolchain]] installed, as well as the [[https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/blob/master/DEPENDENCIES.md][dependencies for Iced]]. Then, building should be as simple as any other Rust project:
#+begin_src sh
cargo build --release
#+end_src
