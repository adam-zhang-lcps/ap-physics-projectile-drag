#+title: Projectile Motion Drag Simulation
#+author: Adam Zhang

Simulating projectile motion with drag and displaying the results. Extra credit assignment for my AP Physics C: Mechanics class. Built using [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] and [[https://iced.rs/][Iced]] üî•.

* Building
*Note: there is no guarantee that this project works at all! If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces ‚ù§Ô∏è.*

To build, you will need the [[https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started][Rust toolchain]] installed, as well as the [[https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/blob/master/DEPENDENCIES.md][dependencies for Iced]]. Then, building should be as simple as any other Rust project:
#+begin_src sh
cargo build --release
#+end_src

* Notes
This project was written very hastily, and thus the code quality is not great. Notably:
+ Generation of the graph is not asynchronous, so changes freeze the UI until the calculations are done.
+ Input fields are not numeric.
